This is a simple program which will insert, update, read, and delete "Owners" and "Cars" in a simple MySQL database.

The application assumes you have run the cars_db_setup.sql script to create the database in MySQL.

You will need to update the connection credentials found in the DatabaseConnection.java file to match your installation.

This program requires the Hibernate Java library, along with a few other dependencies. These can all be found in the lib folder at the root of this repository.

You are welcome to use this code for research purposes and as a model for your own learning. Keep in mind that only minimal error checking is performed. This code is NOT perfect, and probably never will be! Don't treat it as such!

Thanks for taking a look!
